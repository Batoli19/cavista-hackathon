What your system will do (cleanly)
A) Voice in + Voice out

Voice command: you speak → it becomes text → Jarvis decides what to do.

Voice response: Jarvis replies by speaking (text-to-speech), and shows the text on screen (for reliability).

This gives the “Jarvis feel” even if the room is noisy.

B) Project Management Core (the brain)

Jarvis can:

Create projects

Capture project info (deadline, team size, goals, resources)

Generate a plan (tasks + durations + order)

Track execution:

“mark task done”

“delay task by 2 days”

“show status”

Recommend actions if off-track:

reduce scope

parallelize tasks

add resources (even if it’s just a suggestion)

Problem solved: people don’t know how to structure projects and they fall behind without realizing.

C) Local Computer Actions (the hands)

This is where you must be careful: OS automation can get messy. So you pick a small set of actions that are dependable.

Reliable local actions for demo:

✅ Minimize all windows (single command)

✅ Open Notes (Notepad / OneNote)

✅ Open Word / Excel

✅ Open a specific folder / project workspace

✅ Open a URL / open browser

✅ Play/pause music (optional, depends on your setup)

Problem solved: saves time, removes clicking around.

D) “Edit locally” (Word/Excel) — what’s realistic

There are two levels:

Level 1 (Doable + reliable in a week)

Jarvis can:

open Word/Excel

open a specific file (like project_plan.docx or budget.xlsx)

generate the content (plan/budget/notes) and write it into the file

save it locally

That means: Jarvis “edits” documents by updating them and opening them.

Level 2 (Harder, risky)

Jarvis can:

control Word/Excel like a human (click menus, type into cells live, format tables dynamically)

This is possible but tends to break based on window focus, different Office versions, permissions.

Recommendation for demo-proof: do Level 1.

E) Git integration (nice-to-have)

This is a separate plugin/module:

“Jarvis, initialize git repo”

“Commit with message …”

“Push to GitHub”

It’s doable if your team finishes MVP early and you have credentials ready.

But it should not block your core demo.
